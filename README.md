Document my journey of learning about brain-computer interfaces.

## Week 1

### Theoretical knowledge 

- Basic idea about IP / TCP / UDP
- How computers display images
- Basic idea in BMI

### Hands-on Practice

#### Task 1: TCP / IP "Hello World"

- Use C++ and TCP protocol to send a packet containing a string locally and receive and display the string.

#### Task 2: Read and Draw

- Use Qt to read data from an array and draw lines based on the data.

### Advance Task

#### Task 1: TCP / IP Forward

#### Task 2: Read and Draw Forward

- Draw 8 lines
- Know time to draw a graph & image refresh rate & Moving line (Some docs I find below)
